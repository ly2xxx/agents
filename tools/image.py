# We use pydantic to define a GenerateImageInput class which inherits from BaseModel This will allow us to clearly define the input arguments our tool will need in order to run, as the LLM will need this information when calling a tool or deciding whether to call a tool or not.
# We define a single field image_description which is a string and we use Field to add a description to the field. So we want an input argument of image_description which is a string that describes the image we want to generate. If you need multiple arguments you can define these here as well in the same fashion. For our uses, this one argument will do here.

# After that, we declare the function itself, which takes a string as input with the image description and will return an image path in string format. Note that we included a docstring that describes what the tool does: """Generate an image based on a detailed description.""".
# This docstring is required when defining tools using the @tool decorator and is the description that will be used for the OpenAI tool schema generated behind the scenes that helps the LLM agent choose which function(s) to call. For this reason you must make sure it is an adequate description of what the tool does and what itâ€™s purpose is.
