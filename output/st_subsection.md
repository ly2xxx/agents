**Embedding Streamlit Apps**
==========================

Streamlit provides an efficient way to embed one Streamlit app within another. This feature allows developers to create complex applications by combining multiple smaller apps.

### Why Embed Streamlit Apps?

There are several reasons why you might want to embed one Streamlit app within another:

*   **Modularity**: By breaking down your application into smaller, independent modules, you can make it easier to maintain and update individual components without affecting the entire application.
*   **Reusability**: If you have a reusable component that you want to use in multiple places, embedding it within another Streamlit app is an efficient way to do so.
*   **Complexity**: Large applications often require complex layouts or interactions between different components. Embedding one Streamlit app within another allows you to create these complex interactions while still maintaining a clean and organized codebase.

### How to Embed Streamlit Apps

To embed one Streamlit app within another, you can use the `st.subheader()` and `st.write()` functions. Here's an example:

**app1.py**
```python
import streamlit as st

def render_subsection():
    with st.subheader("Subsection from app2"):
        # Render the subsection from app2.py
        import app2
        app2.main()

st.write("Main section of app1")
render_subsection()
```

**app2.py**
```python
import streamlit as st

def main():
    st.header("App 2 Main Section")
    st.write("This is the main section of app2")

    with st.subheader("Subsubsection from app2"):
        st.write("This is a subsubsection from app2")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this example, `app1.py` imports `app2` and calls its `main()` function within the `render_subsection()` function. The `st.subheader()` function is used to render a subsection title, and `st.write()` is used to render the content of that subsection.

### Best Practices

Here are some best practices to keep in mind when embedding Streamlit apps:

*   **Use meaningful names**: When naming your sub-apps, use descriptive names that indicate what each section does.
*   **Keep it organized**: Use `st.subheader()` and `st.write()` functions to render your content in a logical and organized manner.
*   **Test thoroughly**: Make sure to test your embedded app thoroughly to ensure that everything works as expected.

By following these guidelines and best practices, you can create complex Streamlit applications by combining multiple smaller apps.
