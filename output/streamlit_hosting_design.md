# Free Python Streamlit Cloud Hosting Options

Streamlit is a powerful open-source framework that allows developers to easily create interactive web applications for data science and machine learning. With the growing need for sharing these applications, several free hosting options have emerged. This article explores various free Python Streamlit cloud hosting options, their features, and how to deploy and embed Streamlit applications.

## 1. Streamlit Community Cloud

### Overview

### Key Features
- **Rapid Deployment**: Most apps can be launched within minutes by linking your GitHub repository.
- **Free Service**: No costs involved, making it accessible for developers and data scientists.
- **Resource Limits**: 
  - CPU: Up to 2 cores
  - Memory: Up to 2.7GB
  - Storage: Up to 50GB
- **Security Measures**: All communication is encrypted, and access control is enforced.
- **Development Environment**: Supports development in the cloud, allowing configurations via GitHub Codespaces.

### Getting Started
To deploy an app on Streamlit Community Cloud:
1. Create a simple Streamlit app.
2. Set up an account on Streamlit Community Cloud.
3. Connect your GitHub account.
4. Create a repository and push your app.
5. Deploy your app with a few clicks.

### Limitations
While the free tier is robust, it may not support larger applications efficiently. Users exceeding resource limits may experience throttling.

## 2. Hosting with GitHub and Streamlit Community Cloud

### Deployment Steps
Deploying a Streamlit application using GitHub and Streamlit Community Cloud is straightforward:
1. **Create a Simple App**: Write your Streamlit code and save it in a `.py` file.
2. **GitHub Setup**: Create a new GitHub repository and push your code.
3. **Deploy on Community Cloud**: Link your GitHub repository to Streamlit Community Cloud, and your app will be deployed automatically.

For detailed instructions, refer to the [Streamlit blog on hosting](https://blog.streamlit.io/host-your-streamlit-app-for-free/).

## 3. Alternative Free Hosting Options

### Deta
Deta provides a platform for deploying small applications for free. Itâ€™s suitable for lightweight Streamlit applications but may not offer the same integration features as Streamlit Community Cloud.

### Replit
Replit is another option for deploying Streamlit applications. It is an online IDE that allows users to code, run, and share applications directly from the browser.

#### Steps to Deploy on Replit
1. **Create a New Repl**: Start a new Python project.
2. **Install Streamlit**: Use the shell to install Streamlit with `pip install streamlit`.
3. **Write Your App**: Create a main Python file and write your Streamlit code.
4. **Run Your App**: Execute the app through Replit's interface.

### Anvil
Anvil allows users to build and deploy full-stack web applications using Python. It features a drag-and-drop interface for UI design and provides free hosting for basic applications.

## 4. Embedding Streamlit Apps

### Using iframe
Embedding your Streamlit app into a website can enhance user engagement. The most common method is using an iframe.

#### Iframe Embedding Code
```html
<iframe src="YOUR_STREAMLIT_APP_URL" width="700" height="600"></iframe>
```
Adjust the `width` and `height` as necessary.

### oEmbed
For platforms that support oEmbed, simply paste the URL of your Streamlit app, and it will be automatically embedded.

### Best Practices
- Ensure your app is public for embedding.
- Test the embedded app on various devices and browsers for compatibility.
- Use HTTPS for security.

## 5. Security Features in Streamlit Hosting

When hosting applications on platforms like Streamlit Community Cloud, security is paramount. Here are some key security features:
- **Authentication**: Users must authenticate via GitHub.
- **Data Encryption**: All data is encrypted in transit and at rest.
- **Access Control**: Permissions are inherited from GitHub, allowing for granular access management.
- **Incident Response**: Streamlit has protocols for handling security events and vulnerabilities.

For more detailed security practices, refer to the [Streamlit Trust and Security documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud/get-started/trust-and-security).
