# Installing Google Play Store on Huawei P60

Due to trade restrictions imposed by the U.S. government, Huawei devices, including the Huawei P60, do not come pre-installed with Google services. However, there are several methods to install Google Play Store and related services on your device. This guide outlines various approaches, including using MicroG, Googlefier, Gbox, and manual APK installation.

## Method 1: Using MicroG and Aurora Store

**MicroG** is an open-source implementation of Googleâ€™s proprietary Android user space apps and libraries. It allows you to use Google services without having the original Google Play Services installed.

### Steps to Install Google Apps with MicroG:

1. **Download MicroG**:
   - Open your browser and navigate to the MicroG website.
   - Download the following files:
     - Services Framework Proxy
     - com.google.android.gms-hw
     - com.android.vending-hw

2. **Install the Files**:
   - Open the Downloads folder and install the downloaded files in this sequence:
     1. Install `com.google.android.gms-hw` (Google Mobile Services).
     2. Install `com.android.vending-hw` (MicroG Companion).
     3. Install `Services Framework Proxy`.

3. **Configure MicroG**:
   - Open Settings and navigate to **Apps & services** > **Apps**.
   - Search for MicroG, open it, and click on the **Settings** icon.
   - Enable:
     - Google Device Registration
     - Cloud Messaging
     - Google SafetyNet
   - Perform a self-check in MicroG Services and allow all permissions requested.

4. **Log in to Google Account**:
   - In MicroG Services, enter your Google account details.
   - Go to **User and Accounts** in Settings, select **Google**, and enable **Allow Apps to Find Accounts**.

5. **Install Aurora Store**:
   - Download the Aurora Store APK from the AuroraOSS website.
   - Install it on your device.
   - Open Aurora Store, choose **Session Installer**, and follow the prompts to configure it.

6. **Download Google Apps**:
   - Use Aurora Store to search for and install Google apps like Gmail, YouTube, and Google Maps.

### Considerations
- This method provides a workaround to use Google services but may not guarantee full functionality due to the absence of official Google support.

## Method 2: Using Googlefier

**Googlefier** is an application designed to simplify the process of installing Google Mobile Services on Huawei devices.

### Steps to Use Googlefier:

1. **Download Googlefier**:
   - Find and download the Googlefier APK.
   
2. **Install Googlefier**:
   - Open the APK and follow the on-screen instructions to install Google Services.

3. **Complete Setup**:
   - The app will guide you through the setup, including necessary permissions and account configurations.

### Benefits
- Googlefier automates the installation process, making it user-friendly for those less tech-savvy.

## Method 3: Using Gbox

**Gbox** is another tool that allows Huawei users to access Google Play Store and services.

### Steps to Install Gbox:

1. **Download Gbox**:
   - Search for and download the Gbox APK.

2. **Install Gbox**:
   - Open the APK and follow the installation process.

3. **Access Google Play Store**:
   - Once installed, you can access Google Play Store and download apps directly.

## Method 4: Manually Installing APKs

If you prefer not to use these tools, you can manually download and install APK files for specific Google apps.

### Steps for Manual Installation:

1. **Download APK Files**:
   - Find APKs for Google services (like Play Store, Play Services, etc.) from trusted sources.

2. **Enable Unknown Sources**:
   - Go to **Settings** > **Security & Privacy** > **More** > **Install apps from external sources**, and enable permissions for your browser or file manager.

3. **Install the APKs**:
   - Open the downloaded APK files and install them one by one.

### Note:
- Ensure that you download APKs from reputable sources to avoid malware.

## Considerations for Installing Google Services on Huawei P60

- **Legal Implications**: Installing Google services on Huawei devices may breach terms of service, and users should be aware of potential risks.
- **Functionality Limitations**: Some Google apps may not function fully or at all due to the lack of official support.
- **Security Risks**: Using third-party tools or APKs can introduce security vulnerabilities. Users should exercise caution and ensure their devices are secure.

## Conclusion

While installing Google Play Store and services on a Huawei P60 is not straightforward due to restrictions, several methods allow users to access these applications. Whether through MicroG, Googlefier, Gbox, or manual APK installation, users can enhance their Huawei experience by integrating Google services. Always consider the potential risks and legal implications before proceeding.
