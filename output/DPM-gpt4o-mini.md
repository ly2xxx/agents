Creating a suitable investment portfolio involves determining the right mix of assets based on an investor's risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial goals. Below, we outline five distinct types of investment portfolios, categorized by their risk levels, along with example asset allocations for each.

## 1. Conservative Portfolio

A conservative portfolio is designed for investors who prioritize capital preservation and have a low risk tolerance. This type of portfolio typically focuses on fixed-income investments, which provide stable returns with minimal risk.

### Example Asset Allocation
- **20% Stocks**: Focus on high-quality blue-chip stocks or dividend-paying equities.
- **80% Bonds**: Predominantly government bonds and high-grade corporate bonds.
  
**Typical Investors**: Individuals nearing retirement or those who cannot afford to take significant risks.
