# Python Graphic Tools for Rendering Roadmaps and C4 Diagrams

Creating visual representations of project roadmaps and software architecture can significantly enhance understanding and communication among team members. Python offers several libraries and tools that facilitate the generation of these diagrams programmatically. Below, we explore some of the most effective Python graphic tools for rendering roadmaps and C4 diagrams.

## 1. Roadmapper

### Overview
[Roadmapper](https://github.com/csgoh/roadmapper) is a Python library designed specifically for creating roadmaps using code. It allows users to generate professional roadmap diagrams without relying on traditional graphical tools.

### Features
- **Roadmap as Code (RaC)**: Enables the creation and editing of roadmaps efficiently.
- **Version Control**: Roadmaps can be version-controlled using Git, making it easy to track changes and collaborate.
- **Customizable**: Users can set titles, subtitles, timelines, and add logos to their roadmaps.

### Installation
You can install Roadmapper via PyPI:
```bash
pip install roadmapper
```

### Example Code
```python
from roadmapper.roadmap import Roadmap
from roadmapper.timelinemode import TimelineMode

roadmap = Roadmap(1200, 400, colour_theme="BLUEMOUNTAIN")
roadmap.set_title("My Demo Roadmap")
roadmap.set_subtitle("Matariki Technologies Ltd")
roadmap.set_timeline(TimelineMode.MONTHLY, start="2024-01-01", number_of_items=12)
roadmap.add_logo("matariki-tech-logo.png", "top-right", 50, 50)

group = roadmap.add_group("Core Product Work Stream")
task = group.add_task("Base Functionality", "2024-01-01", "2024-10-31")
task.add_milestone("v.1.0", "2024-02-15")
roadmap.set_footer("Generated by Roadmapper")
roadmap.draw()
roadmap.save("demo01.png")
```

## 2. PyStructurizr

### Overview
[PyStructurizr](https://github.com/nielsvanspauwen/pystructurizr) is a Python DSL inspired by Structurizr, aimed at generating C4 diagrams. It allows users to create multiple software architecture diagrams from a single model.

### Features
- **Diagrams as Code**: Users can define their diagrams using Python, leveraging its full power and flexibility.
- **Live Preview**: Offers a development mode for live previews of diagrams in a web browser.
- **Cloud Integration**: Supports uploading diagrams directly to cloud storage.

### Installation
Install PyStructurizr via PyPI:
```bash
pip install pystructurizr
```

### Example Code
```python
from pystructurizr.dsl import Workspace

with Workspace() as workspace:
    with workspace.Model(name="model") as model:
        user = model.Person("User")
        with model.SoftwareSystem("Software System") as software_system:
            webapp = software_system.Container("Web Application")
            db = software_system.Container("Database")
            user.uses(webapp, "Uses")
            webapp.uses(db, "Reads from and writes to")
```

## 3. Diagrams by Mingrammer

### Overview
[Diagrams](https://diagrams.mingrammer.com/) is a tool that allows users to create various types of diagrams, including C4 diagrams, using Python code.

### Features
- **Node and Edge Classes**: Provides classes for defining various components of C4 diagrams.
- **Flexible Layouts**: Supports automatic layout and customization of diagrams.

### Example Code
```python
from diagrams import Diagram
from diagrams.c4 import Person, Container, Database, System, SystemBoundary

with Diagram("Container diagram for Internet Banking System"):
    customer = Person("Personal Banking Customer")
    with SystemBoundary("Internet Banking System"):
        webapp = Container("Web Application")
        database = Database("Database")
    customer >> webapp
```

## 4. Additional Tools for C4 Diagrams

### Other Notable Tools
- **Structurizr**: A web-based tool that supports C4 diagrams and allows for "diagrams as code" using its DSL.
- **Mermaid**: A JavaScript-based diagramming tool that supports C4 diagrams and can be integrated into Markdown files.
- **PlantUML**: A tool that allows users to write diagrams as code, including support for C4 diagrams through an additional project.

## Conclusion

Python provides a rich ecosystem of libraries and tools for rendering roadmaps and C4 diagrams. Whether you prefer a code-based approach with libraries like Roadmapper and PyStructurizr or visual tools like Diagrams, there are options available to suit your needs. These tools not only enhance productivity but also improve collaboration and communication within teams.
