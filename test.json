It chronicles the adventures of the title character and his aquatic friends in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom. The series received worldwide critical acclaim, and has gained popularity by its second season. As of 2019, the series is the fifth-longest-running American animated series. Its popularity made it a multimedia franchise, the highest rated Nickelodeon series, and the most profitable intellectual property for Paramount Consumer Products. By 2019, it had generated over $13 billion in merchandising revenue.[4] Many of the series' ideas originated in The Intertidal Zone, an unpublished educational comic book Hillenburg created in 1989 to teach his students about undersea life.[5] Hillenburg joined Nickelodeon in 1992 as an artist on Rocko's Modern Life.[6] After Rocko was cancelled in 1996, he began developing SpongeBob SquarePants into a television series that same year, and in 1997, a seven-minute pilot was pitched to Nickelodeon. The network's executives wanted SpongeBob to be a child in school, but Hillenburg preferred SpongeBob to be an adult character.[7] He was prepared to abandon the series, but compromised by creating a boating school so SpongeBob could attend school as an adult.[8] The series has run for a total of fourteen seasons, and has inspired three feature films: The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie (2004), Sponge Out of Water (2015), and Sponge on the Run (2020). Two spin-off series, Kamp Koral: SpongeBob's Under Years and The Patrick Star Show, premiered in 2021. As of February 2022, four additional films are planned: three character spinoff films for Paramount+ and Netflix, and a theatrical SpongeBob film. The fourteenth season of the main series was announced in March 2022,[9] and premiered in November 2023. In September 2023, the show was renewed for a fifteenth season.[10] SpongeBob SquarePants has won a variety of awards including six Annie Awards, eight Golden Reel Awards, four Emmy Awards, two BAFTA Children's Awards, and a record-breaking twenty Kids' Choice Awards. A Broadway musical based on it opened in 2017 to critical acclaim.[11] The series is also noted as a cultural touchstone of Generation Z.[12][13] Premise Characters Main article: List of SpongeBob SquarePants characters The series' main characters. Top row, from left to right: Pearl, Plankton, and Karen. Bottom row: Sandy, Mr. Krabs, SpongeBob, Squidward, Gary, Patrick, and Mrs. Puff. The series revolves around the title character and an ensemble cast of his aquatic friends. SpongeBob SquarePants is an energetic and optimistic yellow sea sponge who lives in a submerged pineapple. SpongeBob has a childlike enthusiasm for life, which carries over to his job as a fry cook at a fast food restaurant called the Krusty Krab. One of his life's greatest goals is to obtain a boat-driving license from Mrs. Puff's Boating School, but he never succeeds. His favorite pastimes include \\\"jellyfishing\\\", which involves catching jellyfish with a net in a manner similar to butterfly catching, and blowing soap bubbles into elaborate shapes. He has a pet sea snail with a pink shell and a blue body named Gary, who meows like a cat. Living two houses away from SpongeBob is his best friend Patrick Star, a dimwitted yet friendly pink starfish who resides under a rock. Despite his mental setbacks, Patrick sees himself as intelligent.[14] Squidward, SpongeBob's next-door neighbor and co-worker at the Krusty Krab, is an arrogant, ill-tempered octopus who lives in an Easter Island moai. He enjoys playing the clarinet and painting self-portraits but hates his job as a cashier. He dislikes living between SpongeBob and Patrick because of their childish nature. The owner of the Krusty Krab is a miserly, greedy red crab named Mr. Krabs who talks like a sailor and runs his restaurant as if it were a pirate ship. He is a single parent with a teenage daughter, a grey sperm whale with red lipstick and a yellow ponytail named Pearl, to whom he wants to bequeath his riches. Pearl does not want to continue the family business and would rather spend her time listening to music or working at the local shopping mall.[15] Another of SpongeBob's friends is Sandy Cheeks, a thrill-seeking and athletic squirrel from Texas, who wears an air-filled diving suit to breathe underwater.[16] She lives in a tree enclosed in a clear glass dome locked by an airtight, hand-turned seal and is an expert in karate. Located across the street from the Krusty Krab is an unsuccessful rival restaurant called the Chum Bucket.[17] It is run by a small, green, one-eyed copepod[18] named Plankton and his computer wife, Karen.[19] Plankton constantly tries to steal the secret recipe for Mr. Krabs's popular Krabby Patty burgers, hoping to gain the upper hand and put the Krusty Krab out of business.[20] Karen supplies him with evil schemes to obtain the formula, but their efforts always fail and their restaurant rarely has any customers.[21] When SpongeBob is not working at the Krusty Krab, he is often taking boating lessons from Mrs. Puff, a paranoid but patient pufferfish. SpongeBob is Mrs. Puff's most diligent student and knows every answer to the oral exams he takes, but he panics and crashes when he tries to drive a real boat.[22] When Mrs. Puff endures one of SpongeBob's crashes or is otherwise frightened, she puffs up into a ball.[23] An unseen figure called the French Narrator often introduces episodes and narrates the intertitles as if the series were a nature documentary about the ocean. His role and distinctive manner of speaking are references to the oceanographer Jacques Cousteau.[24] Recurring guest characters appear throughout the series including: the retired superheroes Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, who are idolized by SpongeBob and Patrick; a pirate specter known as the Flyi\", \"Stephen Hillenburg - Wikipedia Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Creator of SpongeBob SquarePants (1961\\u20132018) Stephen HillenburgHillenburg in 2011, presenting the original series bible for SpongeBob SquarePantsBornStephen McDannell Hillenburg(1961-08-21)August 21, 1961Lawton, Oklahoma, U.S.DiedNovember 26, 2018(2018-11-26) (aged 57)San Marino, California, U.S.Alma mater Humboldt State University (BS) California Institute of the Arts (MFA) OccupationsAnimatorwriterproducerdirectorvoice actormarine biologistYears active1984\\u20132018Notable workSpongeBob SquarePants (1999\\u20132018)Rocko's Modern Life (1993\\u20131996)Spouse Karen Umland \\u200b(m. 1998)\\u200bChildren1Scientific careerFieldsMarine biologyInstitutionsOrange County Marine Institute Signature Stephen McDannell Hillenburg (August 21, 1961 \\u2013 November 26, 2018) was an American animator, writer, producer, director, voice actor, and marine biology educator. He is best known for creating the animated television series SpongeBob SquarePants for Nickelodeon in 1999. Serving as the showrunner for its first three seasons, and again from season nine until his death, the show has become the fifth-longest-running American animated series. He also provided the original voice of Patchy's pet, Potty the Parrot. Born in Lawton, Oklahoma and raised in Anaheim, California, Hillenburg became fascinated with the ocean as a child and developed an interest in art. He started his professional career in 1984, instructing marine biology at the Orange County Marine Institute, where he wrote and illustrated The Intertidal Zone, an informative picture book about tide-pool animals, which he used to educate his students. After two years of teaching, he enrolled at California Institute of the Arts in 1989 to pursue a career in animation. He was later offered a job on the Nickelodeon animated television series Rocko's Modern Life (1993\\u20131996) following the success of his 1992 short films The Green Beret and Wormholes, which were made as part of his studies. In 1994, Hillenburg began developing The Intertidal Zone characters and concepts for what became SpongeBob SquarePants, which has aired continuously since 1999. He also directed The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie (2004), which he originally intended to be the series finale. He then resigned as showrunner, but remained credited as executive producer on subsequent seasons (even after his death). He later resumed creating short films with Hollywood Blvd., USA (2013). He co-wrote the story for the second film adaptation of the series, The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water (2015), and received a posthumous executive production credit for the third film, The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run (2020). Besides his two Emmy Awards and six Annie Awards for SpongeBob SquarePants, Hillenburg also received other recognitions, such as an accolade from Heal the Bay for his efforts in elevating marine life awareness and the Television Animation Award from the National Cartoonists Society. Hillenburg announced he was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in 2017, but stated he would continue working on SpongeBob for as long as possible. He died from the disease on November 26, 2018, at the age of 57. Early life and education[edit] Stephen McDannell Hillenburg[1] was born on August 21, 1961 at Fort Sill,[2][3][4][5] a United States Army post in Lawton, Oklahoma, where his father, Kelly N. Hillenburg Jr. (1936\\u20132006),[6] worked for the U.S. military.[7] His mother, Nancy (n\\u00e9e Dufour),[6] taught visually impaired students.[2][3][4] When he was a year old,[7] the family moved to Orange County, California,[2][4] where his father began a career as a draftsman and designer in the aerospace industry.[7] His younger brother, Bryan,[6] eventually became a draftsman/designer as well.[4] When an interviewer asked Hillenburg to describe himself as a child, he replied that he was \\\"probably well-meaning and naive like all kids.\\\"[8][9] His passion for sea life can be traced to his childhood, when films by Jacques Cousteau, a French oceanographer, made a strong impression on him.[4][7][10] Hillenburg said that Cousteau \\\"provided a view into that world\\\", which he had not known existed.[7] He liked to explore tide pools as a child, bringing home objects that \\\"should have been left there and that ended up dying and smelling really bad.\\\"[9] Hillenburg also developed his interest in art at a young age.[7][11] His first drawing was of an orange slice. An illustration which he drew in third grade, depicting \\\"a bunch of army men ... kissing and hugging instead of fighting\\\", brought him the first praise for his artwork, when his teacher commended it.[7] \\\"Of course, this is 1970 ... She liked it because, I mean, obviously that was in the middle of [the Vietnam War]. She was, I would imagine, not a hundred percent for the war like a lot of people then. ... I had no idea about the implications, really, because I just thought it was a funny idea. I remember that still, that moment when she said, 'oh my gosh, look at that'\\\", Hillenburg elaborated.[7] It was then when he knew he \\\"had some [creative] skill\\\".[7] He asserted that his artistry came from his mother's side, despite his father being a draftsman, noting that his maternal grandmother was \\\"really, really gifted\\\" and a \\\"great painter\\\".[7] In the 1970s, someone took Hillenburg to the International Tourn\\u00e9e of Animation at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. He was \\\"knocked out\\\" by the foreign animated films, including Dutch animator Paul Driessen's The Killing of an Egg (1977). \\\"That was the film that I thought was uniquely strange and that lodged itself in my head early on,\\\" he recounted.[12] \\\"I've always been interested in art and making things, but I chose not to go to art school because I thought I needed to do something else. Art was a tough way to make a living. I've always done both. I just kind of figured that the marine biology would be a career and the art would be something I did for my own self-expression.\\\" \\u2014 Stephen Hillenburg[8] He attended Savanna High School in Anaheim,[4][8][13] describing himself as a \\\"band geek\\\" who played the trumpet.[7] At age 15, he snorkeled for the first time;[3][4][8] Hillenburg took part in a \\\"dive program\\\"[7] at Woods Coves[8] in Laguna Beach,[3][4] as part of the Regional Occupational Program at Savanna.[7] This experience, as well as subsequent dives,[7] reinforced his interest in, and led to his decision to study, marine biology in college:[3][4][7][8][13] \\\"The switch clicked and I decided I wanted to be a marine biologist, but I also liked being an artist.\\\"[11] Some of his high-school teachers, who knew of his interest in art and fascination with the ocean, advised him otherwise,[7] saying: \\\"You should just draw fish.\\\"[7][14] However, the idea of drawing fish seemed boring to him and he was more riveted by \\\"making weird, little paintings\\\".[7] During a few summers after finishing high school, he worked as a fry cook and lobster boiler[15] at a fast-food seafood restaurant[4] in Maine.[15] (This later inspired SpongeBob SquarePants' occupation in the television series, which he would begin developing in 1994.[15]) Hillenburg went to Humboldt State University in Arcata, California, as a marine-science major.[7] He minored in art,[7] and said that \\\"[he] blossomed as a painter in Humboldt.\\\"[16] In 1984, he earned his bachelor's degree in natural-resource planning and interpretation, with an emphasis on marine resources.[3][4][13][17] He intended to take a master's degree, but said it would be in art:[7] \\\"Initially I think I assumed that if I went to school for art I would never have any way of making a living, so I thought it might be smarter to keep art my passion and hobby and study something else. But by the time I got to the end of my undergrad work, I realized I should be in art.\\\"[4] Early career[edit] Hillenburg taught marine ocean biology to visitors of the Orange County Marine Institute (pictured) in Dan\", \"The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water - Wikipedia Jump to content From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia 2015 animated/live action film by Paul Tibbitt The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of WaterTheatrical release posterDirected byPaul Tibbitt[a]Screenplay by Jonathan AibelGlenn Berger Story by Stephen HillenburgPaul Tibbitt Based onSpongeBob SquarePantsby Stephen HillenburgProduced by Paul Tibbitt Mary Parent Starring Antonio Banderas Tom Kenny Clancy Brown Rodger Bumpass Bill Fagerbakke Carolyn Lawrence Mr. Lawrence Matt Berry CinematographyPhil M\\u00e9heuxEdited byDavid Ian SalterMusic byJohn DebneyProductioncompanies Paramount Animation Nickelodeon Movies United Plankton Pictures Distributed byParamount PicturesRelease dates January 28, 2015 (2015-01-28) (Belgium)[1][2] February 6, 2015 (2015-02-06) (United States) Running time92 minutes[3]CountryUnited StatesLanguageEnglishBudget$60\\u201374 million[4][5]Box office$325.2 million[4] The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water is a 2015 American adventure comedy film based on the animated television series SpongeBob SquarePants. Directed by series veteran Paul Tibbit, the film stars Antonio Banderas as the live-action character Burger Beard and features the show's regular voice cast consisting of Tom Kenny, Clancy Brown, Rodger Bumpass, Bill Fagerbakke, Carolyn Lawrence, and Mr. Lawrence, with Matt Berry as a new character. The plot follows a pirate named Burger Beard, who steals the secret Krabby Patty formula using a magical book that makes any text written upon it come true. SpongeBob and his friends must travel to the ocean's surface to confront Burger Beard and retrieve the formula. It is the second theatrical film based on the series following the first in 2004. The film was written by Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger; they adapted it from a story conceived by Tibbit and SpongeBob creator Stephen Hillenburg. Like the first film, the final act places the animated characters in a live-action world. However, unlike the first film, the animated characters become animated in CGI in the live-action world. These scenes were directed by Mike Mitchell and were filmed in Savannah and Tybee Island, Georgia. Filming began on September 30, 2013, and was completed in November that year. The film is dedicated to Ernest Borgnine, the voice of Mermaid Man, who died in 2012. Similarly, it features the final film role of Tim Conway, the voice of Barnacle Boy, before his death in 2019. The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water was released in the United States on February 6, 2015, in 3D and RealD 3D and received mostly positive reviews from critics. It was a box office success, earning over $325 million worldwide against its $60\\u201374 million budget, making it the third-highest-grossing Nickelodeon film and the 6th highest-grossing animated film of 2015. A third film, The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run, was released in 2020. Plot[edit] A pirate named Burger Beard travels to Bikini Atoll, where he obtains a magical book that has the power to make any text written upon it real. The book tells the story of SpongeBob SquarePants and his adventures in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom. SpongeBob works for Mr. Krabs at the Krusty Krab fast food restaurant, where he cooks Krabby Patties. SpongeBob has spent several years protecting the secret formula of the Krabby Patty from Plankton, the owner of the rival Chum Bucket. One day, Plankton attacks the Krusty Krab in an attempt to steal the formula. After a battle involving giant foods and condiments, Plankton feigns surrender and uses a decoy of himself to gain access to Krabs' vault. Plankton steals the formula, leaving a fake document in its place. SpongeBob catches Plankton and they fight over the formula, which abruptly disappears. Without the secret formula, Krabby Patties cannot be made and the customers become ravenous. Although Mr. Krabs believes Plankton is responsible, SpongeBob knows Plankton is innocent; the two escape Krabs by flying away in a soap bubble. Bikini Bottom is subsequently reduced to a wasteland due to the absence of the Krabby Patties. After a struggle between Burger Beard and some seagulls, a page of the book is discarded in the ocean and lands on Sandy Cheeks' tree dome. SpongeBob proposes teaming up with Plankton to find the formula, and the two decide to travel back in time to the moment before the formula disappeared. SpongeBob and Plankton assemble the machine and travel far into the future, where they meet Bubbles, a magical bottlenose dolphin who acts as an overseer of the galaxy, and inadvertently get him fired. After escaping a furious Bubbles, SpongeBob and Plankton retrieve the formula from the past, but upon returning to their time, they discover that it is the fake one previously left by Plankton. A deranged Sandy suggests a sacrifice to appease the \\\"sandwich gods\\\" for Krabby Patties and SpongeBob volunteers. As the town attempts to do so, the latter alerts the crowd that he smells Krabby Patties, which Mr. Krabs also smells. The townsfolk follow the scent, which leads to the surface. Bubbles returns, telling SpongeBob that he hated his job and is grateful that he was fired. He repays SpongeBob by granting him and his friends the ability to breathe on land in order to follow the smell. The team lands on a beach and discovers that the smell leads to Burger Beard's ship, which he has converted into a food truck. Burger Beard is revealed to have stolen the formula using the magical book. He then uses the book to banish the group to an island full of pelicans. SpongeBob uses the page Sandy had to transform himself and the others into superheroes. They return and find Burger Beard, who drives away with the formula, and give chase. During the ensuing battle, the team destroys the book, but Burger Beard manages to overpower them. Plankton appears as a muscle-bound hero and attacks Burger Beard. With SpongeBob's help, the two reclaim the formula and send Burger Beard flying back to Bikini Atoll. The gang uses the final page's magic to return to Bikini Bottom. With the Krabby Patties back, the city is returned to normal and Plankton resumes his role as business rival.
